# Leek Fritters
Serves 4

Don't be put off by the long list of ingredients. You are likely to find many of them in your kitchen cupboard. You also don't have to make the sauce. A squirt of lemon or lime juice will suffice.

### Ingredients:
**Sauce**
* 1/2 cup Greek yogurt
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 2 tbsp lemon juice
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 cup parsley leaves, chopped
* 2 cups cilantro leaves, chopped

**Fritters**
* 3 leeks (1 lb in total, trimmed weight)
* 5 shallots, finely chopped
* 2/3 cup olive oil
* 1 fresh red chile, seeded and sliced
* 1/2 cup parsley (leaves and fine stalks), finely chopped
* 3/4 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1/4 tso ground tumeric
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 egg white
* 3/4 cup plus 1 tbsp self-rising flour
* 1 tbsp baking powder
* 1 egg
* 2/3 cup milk
* 4 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted

### Directions
1) To make the sauce. Blitz all the ingredients together in a food processor until a uniform green. Set aside for later.

2) Cut the leeks into scant 1 inch-thick slices rinse and drain dry. Saut√© the leeks and shallots in a pan with half the oil on medium heat for about 15 minutes, or until soft. Transfer to a large bowl and add the chile, parsley, spices, sugar, and salt. Allow to cool down.

3) Whisk the egg white to soft peaks and fold it into the vegetables. In another bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, whole eg, milk, and butter to form a batter. Gently mix it into the egg white and vegetable mixture.

4) Put 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil in a large frying pan and place over a medium heat. Spoon about half of the vegetable mixture into the pan to make four large fritters. Fry them for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp. Remove to paper towels and keep warm. Continue making the fritters, adding more oil as needed. You should end up with about eight large fritters. Serve warm, with the sauce on the side or drizzled over.
