# Leek Fritters
Serves 4

### Ingredients:
**Sauce**
* 1/2 cup Greek yogurt
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 2 tbsp lemon juice
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 cup parsley leaves, chopped
* 2 cups cilantro leaves, chopped

**Fritters**
* 3 leeks (1 lb in total, trimmed weight)
* 5 shallots, finely chopped
* 2/3 cup olive oil
* 1 fresh red chile, seeded and sliced
* 1/2 cup parsley (leaves and fine stalks), finely chopped
* 3/4 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1/4 tso ground tumeric
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 egg white
* 3/4 cup plus 1 tbsp self-rising flour
* 1 tbsp baking powder
* 1 egg
* 2/3 cup milk
* 4 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted

### Directions
1) To make the sauce. Blend all the sauce ingredients together in a food processor until a uniform green. Set aside.

2) Cut the leeks into 1 inch-thick slices rinse and drain dry. Saut√© the leeks and shallots in a pan with half the oil on medium heat until soft, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and add the chile, parsley, spices, sugar, and salt. Allow to cool down.

3) Whisk the egg white to soft peaks and fold it into the vegetables. In another bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, whole egg, milk, and butter to form a batter. Gently mix it into the egg white and vegetable mixture.

4) Put 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Spoon about half of the vegetable mixture into the pan to make four large fritters. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp. Remove and place on a plate with paper towels to soak up excess oil and keep warm. Continue making the fritters, adding more oil as needed. You should end up with about eight large fritters. Serve warm or cool with sauce on the side or drizzled over. If opting to not make the sauce, drizzle with lemon or lime juice.
